Submission of Backend Intern Test of EZ.

## Deployment to production environment:

As per my knowledge to deploy the test on production environment some step by step procedure should be taken:-

#### web server:- Install the production ready web server and configure it to run flask application.

#### Proxy:- Use a reverse proxy to forward requests from the internet to Flask application.

#### Database:- Use a production-ready database like PostgreSQL or MySQL to store user data and other relevant information here i used MySQL in phpMyAdmin Update Flask app to use the production database.

#### Environment variables:- Use environment variables for sensitive information like secret keys, database connection strings, and other configurations.

#### Security:- Implement secure practices like securing against SQL injection, using HTTPS, validating and sanitizing inputs, and securing sensitive data.

#### Update Management:- Establish a process for safely updating application when new releases or security patches are available.
